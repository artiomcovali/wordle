# wordle
My take on the popular game "Wordle" (This is my first python project I did completely solo with no tutorials or help :D)

Note: This may not work in CMD because it doesn't accept the color codes :(. However, it works perfectly fine in macos and linux terminal along with the vscode terminal.
